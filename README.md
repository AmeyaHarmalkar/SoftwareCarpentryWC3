The public repository for generating and editing a website.


## Project

The project at hand is to develop .py scripts for mundane mathematical tasks at hand. 
We have initiated it with a very basic task of uploading a trivial task of adding up the even numbers in a particular range, say 1 to 100.

### Prerequisites

To operate using our mundane .py scripts, you would need to install a version of Python or Jupyter Notebook (or probably any other software that allows you to play around with .py scripts)

Yo use our .py scripts simply follow the next procedure

```
python3 <filename>.py 
```
In case where you need an input, pass on a sys.stdin and the input file. 
Note : You can also argparse it, but this is convenient for starters!

```
python3 <filename>.py < file.txt
```
